2. CSS Styling:
   - Applies styles to elements for consistent layout and appearance.
   - Defines styles for forms, buttons, list items, headers, and footer.
   - Ensures responsiveness and readability across devices.

3. JavaScript Functionality:
   - Manages customer data using an array (`customers`) to store customer details.
   - Provides functions to add, display, and delete customers.
   - Implements event listeners to handle form submissions and button clicks.
